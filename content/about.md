Hi, I'm Sarah! I'm a freelance web developer, artist, plant mom, and tea enthusiast. I work primarily with a Javascript stack (though I've been known to tinker in Ruby & Python) on application-layer development with a focus on usability and creating common good.

You can find my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/burgundyshark/), my doodles on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/burgundyshark), my resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-robin/), and drop me a line on [Mastodon](https://lgbt.io/@burgundyshark).
