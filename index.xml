      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Sarah! I&amp;rsquo;m a freelance web developer, artist, plant mom, and tea enthusiast. I work primarily with a Javascript stack (though I&amp;rsquo;ve been known to tinker in Ruby &amp;amp; Python) on application-layer development with a focus on usability and creating common good.
You can find my code on GitHub, my doodles on Dribbble, my resume on LinkedIn, and drop me a line on Mastodon.

      <description>Dear internet still using floats for page layout,
Why not flexbox?
Is it because you’re worried about browser support? You shouldn’t be. Unless you need to support IE 10 and under (which is the definition of true sadness in 2016), you’re supported!
Is it because you’re using a prefab grid system in a larger framework? Well, both Bootstrap and Foundation have moved to flexbox grids instead of float-based ones. In fact, a lot of what flexbox allows you to do is recreate complex layouts that used to require a framework in just a couple of lines of vanilla CSS!</description>
